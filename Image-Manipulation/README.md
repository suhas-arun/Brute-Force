# Image Manipulation with Python (For Google Code-In)

The program is run using the command `python main.py example.png` where `example.png` is an image file in the current directory.

The program uses the `PIL` library to resize the image.

As an example I used [fedora.png](https://github.com/suhas-arun/Google-Code-In/blob/master/Image-Manipulation/fedora.png) (a 728x724 image) and the program scaled the image down to 300x298: [fedora_copy.png](https://github.com/suhas-arun/Google-Code-In/blob/master/Image-Manipulation/fedora_copy.png).
