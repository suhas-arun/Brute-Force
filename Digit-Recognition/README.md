# Digit Recognition (for Google Code-In)

The program loads the MNIST dataset (which contains both the training and test data) and uses a State Vector Machine to recognise the digits in the image with an accuracy of almost 98%.

Note: There is no output between 0:13 and 6:39 as training is happening during this time.
