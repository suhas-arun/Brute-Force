# Network Traffic Analysis (For Google Code-In)

I used `wireshark` to analyse [analyze-me.pcap](./analyze-me.pcap). There are 7 possible commands:

1. Show the 10 most visited sites
2. Show user agents
3. Show full connection details (the protocol, source IP and port and destination IP and port for each connection)
4. Grep mode (search for any string in [analyze-me.pcap](./analyze-me.pcap))
5. Show IP lists
6. Show port list
7. Exit
