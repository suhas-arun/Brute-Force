# Twitter Bot for posting articles from Fedora Magazine (For Google Code-In)

The program first scrapes the name and url of all the new articles from fedoramagazine.org using Selenium.

It then tweets the name and url of these articles one by one.

The recording in recording.mp4 shows the program scraping the articles from the webiste, logging into Twitter and then the first few tweets. The video is cut short as the process of tweeting all the articles took a very long time.
