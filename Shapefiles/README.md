# Shapefiles and maps (For Google Code-In)

I downloaded shapefiles from [extract.bbbike.org](https://extract.bbbike.org/) for Oxford, London, Bangalore, New York and Melbourne.

I made a Jupyter notebook for each city, in which I used the `geopandas` library to plot the following shapefiles 
 * buildings
 * landuse
 * natural
 * railways
 * waterways
 * landuse, natural and waterways together
 
 (I did not plot the buildings shapefile for New York as the files were too large).
