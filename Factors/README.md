# Factor finder (For Google Code-In)

Script that finds the factors for an entered number, `n`.

This is done by iterating up to the square root of `n` and checking if each number divides into `n`. If so, then this number is appended to a list of factors, as well as the number it is multiplied by to give `n`.
