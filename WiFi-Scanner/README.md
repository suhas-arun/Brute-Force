# Script to know who is on your WiFi (For Google Code-In)

Script that finds the number of devices on the current network. The user then has the option to show the MAC addresses of these devices. The code is in [main.py](./main.py) but there is another version in [getmac.py](./getmac.py) which uses `getmac` to get the MAC address.
